  The Cub Scout program helps to meet your child’s growth needs. As a child develops, they have specific developmental needs such as:

        They can do this through games, sports, and crafts. As they develops their
        coordination, they gain a sense of worthiness and acceptance by their peers.

      heading: Learn to get along with kids of their same age
      text: >
        They need to form friendships with other kids. They need to learn how to balance giving and receiving affection if they are to relate well to their peers. They need to belong to a group of kids their own age. Being a part of a Cub Scout den helps fulfill these needs.

      heading: Develop their mental processes
      text: >
        They can develop their mental process by reading, writing, and calculating. They need opportunities to use language to express ideas and to influence others. They must move from a preoccupation with self to understanding how and what others think of them. Opportunities for observation and experimentation will help them learn self-reliance. Den activities and meetings, along with the advancement pro- gram, help them develop mentally.

      heading: Develop a value system
      text: >
        They are developing a sense of what is right and wrong and what is fair and unfair. They will do this by cooperating with other kids, by being taught, by examples of adults, and from positive reinforcement. They begin to develop democratic social attitudes.

      heading: Develop personal independence
      text: >
        They are becoming less dependent on adults. Their same age friends become important to them. In their den, and in the pack, they exercise their independence while learning to get along with others.

  heading: What we offer
  description: >
    Your child also needs to belong to a ‘‘group’’ of kids their own age. This group is a key component of the Cub Scout program. A den is like a neighborhood group of six or eight kids in which they will achieve status and recognition.
    As you learn more about how Cub Scouting works and what goes on in a den and a pack, you will see that the program helps your child in these five important developmental needs. The uniqueness of Cub Scouting is that you, as his family, join the program with your child. You will help them all along the way.
